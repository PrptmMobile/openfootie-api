# Introduction

The aim of the current project is to simulate the experience of football from the match engine to the competition level 
and maybe beyond. While the core of such simulation would be the match engine, it would be uninteresting if the 
surrounding ecosystem was ignored (or neglected, for that matter).

While my core interests lie in the simulation of a football match, not necessarilly in the form of a full-blown 3D 
eye-candy match engine (although that would also be desirable); after all there are so many ways in which you can 
simulate a football match, by focusing on different aspects (this would be the scope of a different document), 
the current document is about the functionality having to do with the football competition logistics.

The first release (0.1) supports basic knockout tournament templates and round-robin competitions, with top European clubs 
and nations, however there are quite a few ways and directions for this project to be grown. This document will present 
those, out of which a backlog of technical issues (tasks) will be created. Feedback (and even contributions) will be 
appreciated from anyone interested. While I am currently working on my own stuff full-time and I will continue to do so
for at least the next few months, whatever will be described in this document is only part of my total work (consuming 
rougly 1/12th of my time). The reasons for this document are, first organizational (articulating my own plans beyong 
draft handwritten notes), second prioritization (feedback would help in that direction), third advertising and promotion
(spread the word about the project and invite potential contributors) and fourth feedback about the project itself (by
contributing new ideas and expressing opinions about the project in general). I thank you in advance for reading this and
for any feedback you may provide.
